<p>I've just finished module 2. I've had my final project evaluated, my assessment completed. Looking back on these last few months, I'm blown away by the simultaneous fast and slow progression of time while being here. When I think back on the time scale of projects, it seems forever ago that I was working on Traffic spy. The reality: a month, but it feels like so long ago. Then I think back to the beginning of Turing, in module 1. I was unsure I'd be able to hack it, but it doesnt seem that long ago. The reality: many months.</p>

<p>I came to Turing after a bit of a rough, and yet awesome time in my life. Earlier in 2015 I grew despondent with my job as a Research Technician at the University of Florida. I wasnt doing much right at that time. I was lazy, I was (in hindsight) a little depressed. I hated my job, and everything that came along with it. I had decided that enough was enough, and saved all the money I could before I quit. I hung out in Gainesville, FL for a month just recuperating and thinking about what I wanted out of life. I subsequently took a month long, nearly 9,000 mile road trip from Florida through National and State parks to Southern California. From there I drove up the coast to Portland, picked up a friend, and headed for Denver. I didnt really know how it was gonna go or where i'd end up in Colorado. But it all worked out, I had a great time with tons of new experiences. I saw beautiful sights, I had time to think about the world and what my place in it would be. Upon arrival in Denver and moving in with some old buddies, I began talking to them about their current lots in life. 1 of them was a Turing graduate and the other 2, Turing students. They began to tell me all about the program and what they enjoyed about it and I was instantly enamored. I changed the entire plan I had to go to Medical Lab Tech school and dove head first into Turing. I'm so glad I did.</p>

<p>I've really found my place here as a web development student. I spend more time at Turing in a typical week than I was ever willing to do in any other job I've ever had, and it doesnt even feel like work. I love being given new challenges to surmount on a daily basis, and it turns out I'm pretty good at it. I eagerly await the second half of Turing, and all the awesome problems to be solved and new people that will come with it.</p>
